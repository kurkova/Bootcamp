During Bootcamp I worked with: Spring, Hibernate, Testing (Unit tests (JUnit, Mockito), integration tests (Selenium)), programming                                        principles (SOLID, DRY, Clean code), exceptions handling, lambda expression, stream, 
                               design patterns (adapter, builder, decorator, facade, factory, observer, prototype, singleton, strategy)
