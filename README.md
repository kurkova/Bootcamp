# Bootcamp

Java Bootcamp allowed me not only to learn Java language but also to gain the first experience working in the
development environment. Regular “code review” from my mentor (experienced programmer) taught me important principles 
of clean code such as SOLID or DRY. As a result of my studying, I created a “Task” application to manage daily
tasks.
